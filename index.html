      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="about-grid">
      <p>
        I'm Jonathan Thomas, a Systems Engineer and Aerospace Engineering graduate with a strong interest in high-reliability systems, spacecraft design, and engineering processes that demand precision and clarity. I enjoy working at the intersection of technical problem-solving, clean design, and user-centred thinking—whether that’s in engineering projects, digital tools, or interactive learning experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my degree I developed a deep appreciation for systems engineering methodologies, requirements development, and the ability to transform complex technical challenges into structured, elegant solutions. I’ve also built a wide range of projects outside of my course—from maths education platforms to full game systems—driven by curiosity and a desire to help others understand technical ideas more intuitively.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-highlight">
      <p>
        I’m motivated by producing high-quality work, learning continuously, and developing systems that feel thoughtful, reliable, and easy to use. In the future, I aim to combine my engineering background with my long-term goal of becoming a commercial pilot.
