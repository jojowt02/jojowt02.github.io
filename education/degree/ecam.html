        <h2>Modelling and Experimental Validation of a Multi-Electrode Electrochemical 
          Additive Manufacturing System using Sequential Pulsed Deposition</h2>
        <h3>Grade: 84.5%</h3>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) provides a low-energy, 
        room-temperature pathway for metal 3D printing, but suffers from slow 
        deposition rates due to ion depletion around a single electrode. My project 
        explored whether a multi-electrode ECAM configuration, fired sequentially, 
        could improve deposition uniformity and quality while reducing these ion-transport limitations.

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simulate multi-electrode behaviour to predict current density and ion depletion zones.</li>
        <li>Design and prototype a 2×1 ECAM printer capable of sequential pulsed deposition.</li>
        <li>Experimentally assess how pulse duration and electrode spacing affect copper deposition morphology.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether sequential firing can mitigate diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and improve surface quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a custom 3D MATLAB simulation to examine electric-field interactions between electrodes and identify minimum spacing to avoid stray deposition.</li><li>Designed and manufactured a low-cost ECAM test rig, including a modular electrode array, 3D-printed fixtures, and Arduino-based pulse control.</li>
        <li>Performed controlled copper deposition experiments varying inter-electrode gap, firing sequence, and pulse duration (0.05–4 s).</li>
        <li>Analysed all deposits using 3D focus-variation microscopy and custom MATLAB image/point-cloud processing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simulation showed that at least 1 mm spacing is required for independent electric fields and clean operation.</li>
        <li>0.5 s pulsed sequential firing improved surface roughness by ~16% vs. single-electrode control, producing more compact, uniform deposits.</li>
        <li>Long pulses (≥2 s) caused dendritic growth due to ion depletion—confirming the benefit of short recovery periods.</li>
        <li>Very short pulses (0.05–0.25 s) produced dense, smooth nodules and more accurate deposit diameters.</li>
        <li>Major experimental challenge: immersion deposition on brass electrodes caused debris, inconsistent geometries, and degraded repeatability.</li>
      </ul>
        
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        The project successfully delivered the first verified proof-of-concept for a sequentially pulsed, multi-electrode ECAM system using simple hardware. Results demonstrate that sequential firing improves deposition quality and can counteract diffusion-limited effects—offering a promising path toward scalable, low-cost electrochemical 3D printing.
        Future work includes automated Z-axis control, inert microelectrodes (e.g., platinum), improved electrolyte flow, and scaling to larger electrode arrays.

      <h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a room-temperature metal printing method capable of producing microscale structures without high-temperature processing. Its main limitation is slow deposition caused by local ion depletion when only a single microelectrode is used.
          <br> This project investigates a novel solution: 
          <br> 👉 A multi-electrode ECAM system where electrodes fire sequentially
          <br> allowing ion concentration to recover locally between pulses and improving deposition quality.
          <br> I designed, simulated, and experimentally validated a 2×1 ECAM printer using a pulsed direct-current (PDC-LECD) approach, controlled via Arduino.

        It shows that sequential pulsing can overcome ion-transport limits that have historically prevented ECAM from achieving practical throughput.
        
        The system is purposely built from low-cost, easily reproducible components, making it suitable for continued academic research or integration into hobbyist 3D-printing frameworks.
