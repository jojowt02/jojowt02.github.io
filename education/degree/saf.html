      <p class="light" style="max-width: 760px; line-height: 1.75;">
        For the <b>MMME3075 Management and Professional Practice</b> module, I completed an
        individual research project titled <i>“An Overview of SAF and its Implementation in the
        Current and Future Aviation Industry”</i>. The report critically examined
        <b>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</b> as a near- and long-term route to decarbonising
        aviation, exploring fuel chemistry, certification pathways, production scaling and
        policy, as well as the limits of competing technologies.

          This coursework formed a major part of the <b>MMME3075</b> assessment, requiring an
          unsupervised investigation into a <b>new or rapidly advancing aerospace technology</b>.
          Students were asked to research one of several technology areas and produce a
          <b>2,500–3,000 word</b> professional report that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Justified the importance of the chosen technology in a real aerospace context.</li>
          <li>Reviewed the underlying technology, development history and current challenges.</li>
          <li>Assessed prospects for further development, market adoption and competing options.</li>
          <li>Presented clear, reasoned conclusions and recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I chose to focus on <b>the role of SAF in making future air travel more sustainable</b>,
          aligning with my interest in propulsion, systems engineering and the environmental
          challenge facing commercial aviation.

        <p>
          The report provided a structured overview of SAF from first principles through to
          long-term deployment, broken down into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Definition and composition:</b> Clarifying how <b>Sustainable Aviation Fuels</b> differ
            from conventional jet fuels (CJF), including the role of <i>n-alkanes, iso-alkanes,
            cycloalkanes and aromatics</i> in present Jet A-1 fuel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Certification and “drop-in” compatibility:</b> Explaining the requirements of
            <b>ASTM D1655</b>, <b>D7566</b> and <b>D4054</b>, and how they govern which synthetic fuels
            can be blended, reclassified and used within the existing aviation fuel system infrastructure and current aircraft.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>SAF production pathways:</b> Reviewing current approved conversion pathways
            (e.g. <i>HEFA, FT-SPK, ATJ-SPK, HC-HEFA</i>) and the feedstocks they rely on, including
            waste oils, agricultural by-products and algae.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Scaling production:</b> Analysing present SAF production volumes, competition with
            renewable diesel, and the feedstock availability needed to reach 2050 targets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Policy and market drivers:</b> Assessing how legislation and incentives such as
            <i>ReFuelEU</i> and the <i>Sustainable Skies Act</i> influence refinery choices, airline
            offtake agreements and ticket pricing.

        <h2>Key Findings from the Report</h2>
      </div>

      <article class="card card-light education-item">
        <p>
          A central part of the work was examining <b>what SAF can and cannot improve</b> when
          constrained to be a <b>drop-in fuel</b> compatible with the existing fleet and
          infrastructure. Some of the key insights included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Aromatics and emissions:</b> Conventional Jet A-1 typically contains around
            21&nbsp;wt.% aromatics to meet density and seal-swelling requirements. Reducing this
            fraction lowers soot and particulate emissions but is limited by compatibility with
            existing seals and systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Drop-in boundary:</b> ASTM D7566 currently sets a <b>minimum aromatic content of 8%</b>
            for drop-in blends, meaning SAF can improve but not eliminate aromatic-related
            emissions in the near term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Certification cost and timescales:</b> Full approval of a new pathway under
            D4054 requires large volumes of fuel for multi-tier testing and can cost several
            million dollars over a period of years, creating a barrier for new producers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Production imbalance:</b> Despite growing interest, SAF currently represents a
            tiny fraction of global jet fuel use, and refineries often favour <b>renewable diesel</b>
            due to existing incentives and infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Algae as a future feedstock:</b> The report identified algae-derived oils
            (e.g. <i>Botryococcus braunii</i>) as a promising long-term feedstock for SAF, with
            potential to reach very high global production if technical and economic hurdles
            are overcome.
          </li>
        </ul>

  <!-- POLICY & FUTURE OUTLOOK -->

        <p class="section-kicker">Policy & Outlook</p>
        <h2>Short-Term Challenges and Long-Term Ambitions</h2>
      </div>

      <article class="card card-light education-item">
        <p>
          The report argued that while <b>SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet
          fuel</b>, regulatory pressure and policy incentives are shifting the economic balance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mandates:</b> European measures such as <i>ReFuelEU</i> introduce progressively
            increasing minimum SAF blend requirements, driving demand even when costs are high.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Incentives:</b> Instruments like the <i>Sustainable Skies Act</i> in the U.S. offer
            tax credits per gallon of SAF, linked to lifecycle emissions reductions, improving
            the business case for producers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Blending limits:</b> Current standards typically restrict SAF blends to
            <b>50% with conventional jet fuel</b>, but the report notes work underway to enable
            <b>100% SAF use</b> as technology and experience mature.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The overall conclusion was that, while still in its infancy, SAF is the only
          <b>technologically mature, system-compatible</b> option capable of delivering large
          near-term reductions in aviation lifecycle emissions, provided that production can be
          scaled through new feedstocks, investment and policy support.
